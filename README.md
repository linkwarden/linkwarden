## Intro & motivation

**Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages.** The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away (see the inevitability of [Link Rot](https://www.howtogeek.com/786227/what-is-link-rot-and-how-does-it-threaten-the-web/)), Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available.

Additionally, Linkwarden is designed with collaboration in mind, sharing links with the public and/or allowing multiple users to work together seamlessly.

> **Note**
> Our official [Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) offering provides the simplest way to begin using Linkwarden and it's the preferred choice for many due to its time-saving benefits. <br> Your subscription supports our hosting infrastructure and ongoing development. <br> Alternatively, if you prefer [self-hosting](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation) Linkwarden, no problem! You'll still have access to all the premium features.

<details>
<summary><b>A bit of a "history"</b></summary>
Linkwarden has been completely rebuilt and redesigned from ground up, so pretty much the only thing it has in common with its predecessor is the idea behind it - bookmark management.

**What happened to the old version?**
We highly recommend that you don't use the old version because it is no longer maintained and has far fewer features. However, if you still want to check it out, we've forked the old version from the current repository into [this repo](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden-old).
