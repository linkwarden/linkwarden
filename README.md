# Webmarker
### A simple bookmark manager for all your links and resources

> Note: Still under development...

## Setup
### Linux/MacOS:
1. Make sure the MongoDB database and collection is up and running.

2. Edit `/src/config.json` accordingly.

3. Head to the main folder using terminal and run: `(cd api && npm install) && npm install` for the dependancies.

4. Run `(cd api && npm run dev) & npm start` to start the application.

## Motivation
One of the main reason I built this was so that I would start storing every information/resource I find in one place (Without any thirdparty services.)
