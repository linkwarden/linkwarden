## Intro & motivation

**Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages.**

The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away (see the inevitability of [Link Rot](https://www.howtogeek.com/786227/what-is-link-rot-and-how-does-it-threaten-the-web/)), Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available.

Additionally, Linkwarden is designed with collaboration in mind, sharing links with the public and/or allowing multiple users to work together seamlessly.

> [!TIP]  
> Our official [Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) offering provides the simplest way to begin using Linkwarden and it's the preferred choice for many due to its time-saving benefits. <br> Your subscription supports our hosting infrastructure and ongoing development. <br> Alternatively, if you prefer [self-hosting](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation) Linkwarden, no problem! You'll still have access to all the premium features.

<details>
<summary><b>A bit of a "history"</b></summary>
Linkwarden has been completely rebuilt and redesigned from ground up, so pretty much the only thing it has in common with its predecessor is the idea behind it - bookmark management.

**What happened to the old version?**
We've forked the old version from the current repository into [this repo](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden-old).
